# file-operation
this is practise project

Dear Priyanshi

Please find project 1.

Project 1
contained 3 functions 1. addHeaders(), 2. addItems(), 3. showItems()
1. addHeaders(): This function should accept a file path and an array
   containing “name”,”qty” and “price” as arguments and should write it
   in the file. It should return true if operation was successful otherwise false

2.addItems(): This function should accept the same file path as before and
  an array of objects as shown below and should save these objects in the file.
  It should return true if the operation was successful otherwise false.

 let items = [
    { name: "Bread", qty: 4, price: 20 },
    { name: "Milk", qty: 2, price: 35 },
    { name: "Butter", qty: 3, price: 250 },
         ];

3.showtems(): This function should accept the same file path as before and should read and display the file data.

Finally from the main script call these functions in the proper order . The file path to be passed is “./text_files/groceries.csv”
